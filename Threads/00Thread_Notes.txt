1. When java program run, by default main thread starts running
2. Extend Thread Class or Implement Runnable interface
When a class already extending other class then we can not use the Thread class as Java does not allow multiple inheritence hence
we need to implement Runnable interface. But when the class is not extending any other class then the multithreading can be
implemented via either extending Thread class or Implementing Runnable interface.

3. start() initiates new thread
